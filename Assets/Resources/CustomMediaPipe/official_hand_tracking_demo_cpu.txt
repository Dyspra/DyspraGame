# CHANGES:
#  - Add FlowLimiterCalculator
#  - Add ImageTransformationCalculator and flips the input
#  - Use SidePacket instead of ConstantSidePacketCalculator

# MediaPipe graph that performs hands tracking on desktop with TensorFlow
# Lite on CPU.
# Used in the example in
# mediapipe/examples/desktop/hand_tracking:hand_tracking_cpu.

# CPU image. (ImageFrame)
input_stream: "IMAGE:input_video"

# Max number of hands to detect/process. (int)
input_side_packet: "NUM_HANDS:num_hands"

# Complexity of hand landmark and palm detection models: 0 or 1. Accuracy as
# well as inference latency generally go up with the model complexity. If
# unspecified, functions as set to 1. (int)
input_side_packet: "MODEL_COMPLEXITY:model_complexity"

# Whether landmarks on the previous image should be used to help localize
# landmarks on the current image. (bool)
input_side_packet: "USE_PREV_LANDMARKS:use_prev_landmarks"

# Output image. (ImageFrame)
output_stream: "IMAGE:output_video"

# Collection of detected/predicted hands, each represented as a list of
# landmarks. (std::vector<NormalizedLandmarkList>)
# NOTE: there will not be an output packet in the LANDMARKS stream for this
# particular timestamp if none of hands detected. However, the MediaPipe
# framework will internally inform the downstream calculators of the absence of
# this packet so that they don't wait for it unnecessarily.
output_stream: "LANDMARKS:multi_hand_landmarks"

# Collection of detected/predicted hand world landmarks.
# (std::vector<LandmarkList>)
#
# World landmarks are real-world 3D coordinates in meters with the origin in the
# center of the hand bounding box calculated from the landmarks.
#
# WORLD_LANDMARKS shares the same landmark topology as LANDMARKS. However,
# LANDMARKS provides coordinates (in pixels) of a 3D object projected onto the
# 2D image surface, while WORLD_LANDMARKS provides coordinates (in meters) of
# the 3D object itself.
output_stream: "WORLD_LANDMARKS:multi_hand_world_landmarks"

# Collection of handedness of the detected hands (i.e. is hand left or right),
# each represented as a ClassificationList proto with a single Classification
# entry. (std::vector<ClassificationList>)
# Note that handedness is determined assuming the input image is mirrored,
# i.e., taken with a front-facing/selfie camera with images flipped
# horizontally.
output_stream: "HANDEDNESS:multi_handedness"

# Extra outputs (for debugging, for instance).
# Detected palms. (std::vector<Detection>)
output_stream: "PALM_DETECTIONS:palm_detections"
# Regions of interest calculated based on landmarks.
# (std::vector<NormalizedRect>)
output_stream: "HAND_ROIS_FROM_LANDMARKS:hand_rects"
# Regions of interest calculated based on palm detections.
# (std::vector<NormalizedRect>)
